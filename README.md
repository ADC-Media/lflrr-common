# Lefloriare Common Library

This library provides common data structures, utility functions, and other reusable code that can be shared between both frontend and backend applications. It aims to promote code consistency, maintainability, and reusability.

## Installation:

You can use either `yarn add` or `npm install`

```bash
yarn add git+https://github.com/ADC-Media/lflrr-common.git#tag-or-branch
```

Replace `tag-or-branch` with the actual value of desired tag (eg v1.0.0) or branch name (eg main)
